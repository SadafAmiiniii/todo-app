## 🔍 Improvements & Best Practices  

- Define **TypeScript types** for Context instead of using `null`  
- Use more descriptive naming (e.g., `CartContext` instead of `cartContext`)  
- Extract Context into a separate file (e.g., `CartContext.js`)  
- Add features like decrementing or removing items from the cart  
- Write simple tests for Context and components
